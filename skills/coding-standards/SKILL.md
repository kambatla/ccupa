# Coding Standards Skill

This skill defines how code is written and tested. Follow these patterns for consistency.

## When to Use This Skill

Claude should invoke this skill when:
- Writing new components, endpoints, hooks, or services
- Writing or reviewing tests
- Reviewing code for pattern compliance
- Deciding how to structure new functionality
- Unsure about naming, error handling, or file placement

## Language-Specific Files

| File | Use When |
|------|----------|
| `python.md` | Writing backend code (FastAPI, pytest, Python) |
| `react-typescript.md` | Writing frontend code (React, TypeScript, vitest) |

Each file covers both **coding standards** and **testing patterns** for its language.
