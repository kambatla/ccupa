# Coding Standards — Maintenance Guide

Only document what the model would get wrong without instruction: project-specific patterns, APIs, and opinionated choices.

Don't document general best practices — the model already knows them, and spelling them out wastes context and risks anchoring on stale patterns.

Each line should pass the test: "Would Claude do something different or wrong without this line?"
